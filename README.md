[thorod](https://github.com/thebigmunch/thorod) is a CLI utility for torrent creation and manipulation.

## What's a thorod?

Thorod means torrent (of water) in the Tolkien Elvish language of Sindarin.

## Why use thorod?

There are many CLI torrent utilities out there, so here are some unique or notable features of thorod:

* All torrents are unique; a random salt is added to all created/xseeded torrents.
* Supports trackers on the same tier.
* Type less with tracker abbreviations.
	* Includes a number of open public trackers by default.
	* Includes auto generated open and random abbreviations to help balance load between open public trackers.
	* Users can list/add/remove their own tracker abbreviations directly from CLI as well as manually editing config file.
* Generate magnet links on creation or on command.
* Has an xseed command to generate a cross-seedable torrent without re-hashing files.
* View information about a torrent file in the terminal, rather than adding it to a torrent client.
* Simple automatic piece size calculation from 16 KiB to 32 MiB on by default. Users can set manually by option.
* Supports source key in info dict used by private trackers.
